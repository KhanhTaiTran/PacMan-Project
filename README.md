# PacMan-Project
A Pacman game project typically involves creating a replica or variation of the classic arcade game. The project could include features like:

Game Board Design: A maze-like layout with pathways, walls, and dots for Pacman to eat.
Character Behavior: Pacman, controlled by the player, navigates the maze, avoiding ghosts. Ghosts have distinct AI-driven behaviors (e.g., chasing, ambushing, or wandering).
Game Mechanics:
- Collecting dots to increase score.
- Power pellets that allow Pacman to eat ghosts temporarily.
- Losing a life when caught by a ghost.
- Winning by clearing all dots on the board.
